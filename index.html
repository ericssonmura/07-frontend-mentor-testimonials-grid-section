          <p class="testimonial__intro">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if
            not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny&rsquo;s worth.
          </p>

          <p class="testimonial__details">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I&rsquo;ve been
            looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I&rsquo;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          <p class="testimonial__intro">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting
            guidance from them and
            learning from their experiences was easy.
          </p>

          <p class="testimonial__details">“&nbsp;The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and
            present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people.&nbsp;”

          <p class="testimonial__intro">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

          <p class="testimonial__details">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
            some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
            by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
            staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
            team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
            offers. 100% recommend! ”
